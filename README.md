# Reading modes

Read-only, block navigation controls, focus mode, click-to-select (instead of edit) and Bionic mode (Bionic reading). All these modes can be enabled independently or in groups via a topbar button and commands in Command palette.

For each mode, you can choose to enable it only via the command palette, or via the topbar button, or when the graph is loaded (which can be useful for sensitive data). Read-only and navigation controls can also be automatically enabled on mobile only.

### Read-only

Block content and page title can't be edited, but you can still click on links, checkboxes, buttons and all other controls.
You can set letter spacing and line height for better readability.

### Navigation controls

Inserts very subtle controls (arrows in cardinal directions) in the bottom right-hand corner of the main page.

- **Up/Down** move to the **previous/next sibling block**. Hotheys: `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down arrow` by default. If there is no next sibling block, a double chevron is displayed and you navigate to the next sibling block of the first parent to have a next sibling. If there is no previous sibling block, you navigate to the parent.
- **Left/Right** move to the **parent/child block**. `Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right arrow` by default.

### Click-to-select

When you click in a block, it will be selected (blue highleighted) instead of edited on the first click. If you click again (and Read-only is not enabled), you will enter in edit mode. It's like a light, responsive read-only mode!

### Focus mode


### Bionic mode
Display all texts on your current Roam page in a similar way as '[Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com)': put in bold the first part of words, allegedly for **faster, more focused reading and better memorization**

This extension makes changes only on the HTML level (current page display), not on your data!
Settings:
  - **fixation** (percentage of word in bold, from 0 to 100)          
      - default: 50
  - **saccade** (applies every x words, from 1 to 5)          
      - default: 1

### Limitations
- Bionic view is not immediately applied to new unfolded blocks or blocks opened in the sidebar (you need to reapply it to the whole page)
